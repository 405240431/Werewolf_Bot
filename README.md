# Werewolf Bot
This is a shared attempt to build a Werewolf Bot for the Werewolvers server. Contributions are always welcome!
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/werewolves-devs/Werewolf_Bot.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/werewolves-devs/Werewolf_Bot) (Tests are still a work in progress)

For now, the main goal is to give the users a sense of pride and accomplishment. We're gonna start building with a lot of structure, adding wanted functions and allowing people to claim functions if they think they can make it work.
