# Manual for Bot Testers

Hi there! If you're reading this, then your name is probably BenTechy, for the other "contributors" are just freeloaders that barely understand how the bot works and won't even take the effort to open a simple README file. *(If you are not, my dearest apologies.)*

The bot considers the users as three groups; participants, deads 'n'spectators, and non-participants. Only non-participants aren't signed up on the bot. The bot will ignore almost every command, except for a few like the ones that allow you to sign up.

## How to be recognized by the bot

If you no longer wish to be a non-participant, you must type

    !signup <emoji>

to sign up. By default, players become spectators. This means they will always get added to conspiracy channels (but can be removed!), they will not get permission to talk in channels and they will not appear in polls. If you wish for them to appear as participants, type

    !assign <user> <role>

If the bot does not seem to recognize you, there is a 101% chance this is the problem.
