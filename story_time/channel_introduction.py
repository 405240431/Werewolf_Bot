**=========================**
**WELCOME, ASSASSIN**
**=========================**
This town is like an old kitchen... it's a giant mess. Luckily, the town has *you*, 
their protector, who picks out the cockroaches for them and squishes them like the puny animals they are. 
You do not exactly know what is about to happen, but your senses never lie; 
something *TERRIBLE* is happening, and it depends on your actions how much the town will suffer from it!
You do not know your allies, your masters taught you never to trust anyone. However,
you fear you can't do this alone. You must find the ones to save, and especially the ones to kill.
**You are the assassin. Each night (except for the first one), you can attack and kill a player you suspect.
Play the game whichever way you'd like, but try to keep the innocents alive. Good luck.**
